## Design GUI in VB, put it into Java code \!\!\!\!


</div>

### Description

Xtreme VB2J builds java classes from the Visual Basic form files (.frm). Java does not have any built-in Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Graphical User Interface (GUI) design; on the other hand, Visual Basic (VB) has a very nice and easy IDE for GUI design. This software is just an preliminary approach to integrate the power of EASY-GUI-Design of VB and Java to reduce wastage of a-lot-of time in software development.

### Source Code

I have just developed software named Xtreme VB2J that builds java classes from the Visual Basic form files (.frm). Java does not have any built-in Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Graphical User Interface (GUI) design; on the other hand, Visual Basic (VB) has a very nice and easy IDE for GUI design. This software is just an preliminary approach to integrate the power of EASY-GUI-Design of VB and Java to reduce wastage of a-lot-of time in software development.<br><br>
Before Running VB2J
---------------------------
Since this software originally has been designed in Visual Basic, before running, your computer must have Visual Basic Runtime files or Visual Basic itself installed. You may obtain it from MyDownload section of my website or directly from: http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/install/6/Win98Me/EN-US/VBRun60.exe<br><br>
Hope you won’t be sick of Layout Managers anymore!! :) Try it today from the MyDownload section at: www.tanzimsaqib.tk<br><br>
Happy GUI design!! :D
Thank you!<br><br>
